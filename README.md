# Todos

This is a simple data-persistent React Native todo list app.

I'm building this to familiarize myself with React after years of working with Ember.js (and previously Backbone.js). I also wanted to get my feet wet with React Native as a change of pace from web-focused development.

### How to run it locally

This app is built using [`expo`](https://expo.dev), which offers many features, but the best part is that it allows you to build React Native apps without installing all of the platform SDKs (not fun). All you need is Node.js and the Expo app installed on your device.

```
$ yarn install
$ yarn start
```

After that, you just follow the instructions on screen.
